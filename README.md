# Polynomial Multiplication
This program which only uses iostream library, gets two polynomials as input and keeps each of them in a separate linked list. Then, calculates the product of the two in an individual linked list and print it in the output.  

Input:  
1- In the first input line, two numbers m and n, which are the largest power of any polynomial, are given.  
2- In the second line, n+1 numbers that are coefficients of x^n to x^0 are given (Coefficient of x^n must be non-zero).  
3- In the third line, m+1 numbers that are coefficients of x^m to x^0 are given (Coefficient of x^m must be non-zero). 

Output:  
In the only output line, print mâˆ—n+1 numbers which are coefficients of x^(n+m) to x^0 in order.
